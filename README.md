# React Search Challenge

Given an API that returns a list with thousands of records; each record containing a blob of text; how would you design a React UI Component that takes list of words as input, finds all the records that contains them and displays the matching blob of text for the record? You may use any HTML elements for the UI inputs and outputs.
 Requirements:
1. All algorithms must execute client-side
2. UI must be highly performant and snappy
3. Only React and native JS must be used
4. Code uses well known React and JS design patterns 5. Bonus if implemented in Typescript

### Some examples to test
